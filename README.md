# Anderson-TartanGraph-Connectivity-Matrices
The supplementary material the manuscript Anderson et al. Contains the raw data from in-silico experiments and the R code used to analyse data and produce the graphs presented in Anderson et al.

Zipped folder contains the following:

SMS_Inputs - TartanGraphs: The inputs for the RangeShifter dispersal model; the text files encoding the structure of stylised TartanGraph landscapes as well as a word file with pictures of said landscapes.

SMS_Outputs1_Edge_Number_Analysis: Raw data from the first experiment examining the effect of edge number on TartanGraph connectivity.

SMS_Outputs2_Edge_Width_Analysis: Raw data from the second and third experiemnts examining the effect of edge width on TartanGraph connectivity.

R Script_Anderson et al: The R code used to analyse raw data and produce Anderson et al figures. Directory set up in advance to access data in the two output folders described above.

Results - Connectivity parameters (Freq): Word file containing summary statistics for connectivity measures returned by the RangeShifter simulations.

R-Script_Anderson-et-al: Chrome HTML file, a compiled report for the R code included in this folder.
